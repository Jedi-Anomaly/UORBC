# UORBC
UO Renaissance Build Calculator 
developed by: Dathan Phillips

# Skill Management:
The purpose of UORBC is to provide players with the ability to plan their character, while providing useful information about their selected set of skills and stats that otherwise would have to be calculated manually, or seen in-game once their character has completed training. 

How it works: 
Select a skill from the dropdown menu at the top left of the form. Use the slider below that to set the desired skill level (1-100). You can press Skill Info button to read more about that skill. By pressing the button "Add Skill to Build", the skill you have selected, and it's level will be populated in a grid on the right. 

The Skill Grid has two values, Skill name and Skill Value. This information is displayed similar to this:
_____________________
|Swordsmanship | 100 |
---------------------

By clicking on the white box on the left-hand side of the skill name, you will be able to press the "Delete" key to remove a skill you no longer want. You cannot edit the Skill Name column, but you can change the Skill Value at any given time. This value must be a range (1-100). Below the "Add Skill to Build" button, your total skill amount is displayed. This updates any time you add, remove, or change the value of a skill.
